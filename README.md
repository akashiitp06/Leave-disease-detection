# ðŸŒ¿ Leave Disease Detection using ML and CNN
Plant Leave disease and severity Detection

# Overview
This project aims to detect plant leaf disease through image processing techniques and convolutional neural networks (CNN). The system takes images of plant leaves as input and identifies whether the leaves are healthy or infected with a disease. It utilizes machine learning algorithms, particularly CNNs, to classify the images into different disease categories.

# Features
1. Automated detection of plant leaf diseases.
2. Accurate classification of diseases based on image analysis.
3. User-friendly interface for uploading leaf images and viewing the diagnosis results.
4. Capable of handling various types of plant diseases.
5. It takes less time and is easy to use.

NOTE: We are working over 3 data sets: (Train, Valid, and Test) data set containing 38 classes of different leaves with different conditions
